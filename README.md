# RISCV Single Cycle Processor

* Here you will find a complete implementation of a RISCV Single Cycle Processor in Verilog, which includes support for R-type, I-type, U-type, Store, Load, Branch and Jump instructions.

* In the repository, you will find a Verilog code file, testbench code file, assembly code file for the factorial function, and a file containing the machine code for the factorial function.

* To run the factorial function, please consult the provided PDF document which will guide you through the process of setting up the processor and running the code.

* Please note that you will need to update the address in the instruction memory and set the appropriate number of cycles in the testbench file based on the program you are trying to run.

* If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to open an issue or reach out to the repository owner for assistance.
